# Mates Studio Commander Editor


## Introduction

Mates Studio's Commander is the simplest among all the environments. Providing a simple user interface for simply adding predesigned pages to the project, it allows project development to finish within seconds. It also provides a quick discussion of each page added and all the widgets it contains making it a perfect choice for those who are just starting with BBM products.

Commander environment offers two main parts, a project editor and a [host simulator](mates-controller-interface.md). This manual will focus on the project editor including how to add built-in and custom pages and checking a short documentation for the page.
